What is your understanding of Blockchain?
-blockchain works with distributed systems and cryptography encryption that keeps constant record of all the transaction in form of block , that is secure , immutable, and decentralised.


What is the core problem blockchain trying to solve?
-no central dependency
-verifiability
-authenticity.
-security


What are the few features which blockchain will give u?

-verifiability
-immutable
-security
-decentralised: so trust is not on 3rd party or single entity rather trust is on whole block community individually
-tamper-proof


What all things does a Block Contain?

-A block contain several things:
. block number
. transaction detail.
. previous hash key.
. code that will generated the current hash key by taking the current data and previous key.


How is the verifiability of Blockchain is been attained ?

-verifiability is attained as numerous computers shared these blocks so if any block in any computer generates different hash key then the rest of the block in other computers.
other computers will prompt the computer with different block that your data needs to be changed completely in this way verifiability is attained.
